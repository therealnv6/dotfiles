these are my personal dotfiles, should work flawlessly on any other system as
long as you have all of the required dependencies. most of it is based on
[fakecarbon](https://github.com/therealnv6/fakecarbon.conf), take a look at that
project for further information and credits.

# dependencies

- [waybar](/waybar/waybar): there are 3 themes in my waybar config, so feel free
  to check it out!
- [hypr](/hypr): i'm using hyprland in these dotfiles, you could switch this out
  for something like `sway` or anything else that's supported by waybar, but
  you'll have to update the waybar workspace configuration accordingly.
- [kitty](/kitty)
- [tofi](/tofi)
- ~~[fish](/fish)~~: i previously used fish, but switched to zsh.

# Credits

- [cxOrz](https://github.com/cxOrz/dotfiles-hyprland), initially based on this,
  with adjusted color scheme, icons, and script.
