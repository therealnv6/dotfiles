# dotfiles

these are my personal dotfiles, should work flawlessly on any other system as
long as you have all of the required dependencies.

# dependencies

- [waybar](/waybar/waybar): there are 3 themes in my waybar config, so feel free
  to check it out!
- [hypr](/hypr): i'm using hyprland in these dotfiles, you could switch this out
  for something like `sway` or anything else that's supported by waybar, but
  you'll have to update the waybar workspace configuration accordingly.
